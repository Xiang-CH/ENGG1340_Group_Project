Project Proposal:

Our current idea is to make a abbrivated gobang game (five in a row), for two players, with a board of ten rows or more.

No of Players:2

**Rule of the game:**
Each plaer will have a kind of go for example cross and circle. 
The player who come out to have a series of five same gos first wins. It can be horizontal, verticle, or diagonal. 

The game will start by the program initalizing three gos on the board, 2 crosses and 1 circle. 
Then each player will need to enter a number, the computer will also generate a number, the player who guesses more closely will get to choose which go (cross or circle) they intent to play.

Then the player playing circle will start first then followed by player playing cross.

In the game, the computer will intervene the game at some point or at a regular pattern to increase the uncertainityï¼Œexcitement and entertainment.
Which will also make this chess game more 'balance' to some extent.

  - After 4 rounds, before the next player start placing, the computer will randomly swap 2 gos (of difference team).


**Summary:**
