Project Proposal:

Our current idea is to make a chess game for two players, with a board of ten rows or more.

Player:2

Rule of the game:
each plaer will have a kind of chess foe example cross and circle. 
The player who come out to have a series of five same chesses win. 

At the beginning of the game, each player will need to enter a number. 
The computer will also generate a number, the player who guesses more exactly will proceed the game first.

In the game, the computer will intervene the game at some point or at a regular pattern to increase the uncertainityï¼Œexcitement and entertainment.
Which will also make this chess game more 'balance' to some extent.

In the game, there will also be some unusual thing happens but now still not determined.
